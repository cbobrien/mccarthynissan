						<p class="bold">Your vehicle is one of your biggest investments, so protecting it against unexpected circumstances is important.</p>
						<p>
							Unfortunately, life can throw many nasty curve balls your way like theft, hijacking and accidents. Luckily, with Comprehensive Vehicle Insurance, you can rest assured that your car is covered against these unforeseen occurrences.
						</p>
						<p class="bold">
							How it works
						</p>
						<p>
							Just one call gets you up to 16 comparative quotations from most major insurers, covering your vehicle against theft, hijacking and the cost of accident repairs. This means we are able to arrange cover that is tailor made to your specific needs.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is a condition of the finance agreement, the asset must be comprehensively insured at all times.

					<h3>Shortfall Protection</h3>

						An accident or theft of your vehicle will nearly always result in some sort of financial loss. Even when comprehensively insured, there are outstanding amounts that need to be paid.

						<p class="bold">An accident or theft involving your vehicle will nearly always result in some sort of financial loss. Even when your vehicle is comprehensively insured, there are usually outstanding amounts that need to be paid.</p>
						<p>
							These costs are often unforeseen and are not generally covered by most motor insurance policies. Shortfall Protection is probably the most advanced protection product available, and is designed to protect you in a number of ways against these unforeseen losses.
						</p>
						<p class="bold">How it works</p>
						<p class="bold">Shortfall Protection</p>
						<p>
							In the event of a total loss due to theft, hijacking or write off, most insurance companies pay out the value of the vehicle, less any excess amounts due. This pay-out is most often less than what is actually still owing to the finance company. In such cases, Shortfall Protection pays the difference between your insurance company pay-out and the amount still owing to your finance company. This payment also covers your insurance excess up to R6,000. It is important to note that the vehicle insurance must fully cover the value of the vehicle plus all accessories.
						</p>
						<p class="bold">Violation Cover</p>
						<p>
							Should your insurance company reject a claim due to you unintentionally violating a condition of your comprehensive insurance policy (e.g. late notification of a claim, change of address etc.) then Shortfall Protection will pay the claim. However, this policy does not provide cover if you incorrectly insured your vehicle.
						</p>
						<p class="bold">Loyalty Bonus</p>
						<p>
							In the event of a Shortfall claim where your vehicle is stolen and not recovered, or is written off, a Loyalty Bonus of R8,000 will be paid towards a replacement vehicle when purchased from a McCarthy dealership within 3 months of the above event.
						</p>
						<p class="bold">Deposit Protection (Optional)</p>
						<p>
							If you have paid a deposit towards your vehicle purchase, then you need to be aware that the finance company will take priority in terms of an insurance pay-out. This could result in you not recovering the value of your deposit. However, if you have selected the Deposit Protector option, then your deposit will also be protected up to a maximum of R50,000.
						</p>
						<p class="bold">Policy Highlights</p>
						<ul>
							<li>PAY-OUT AND WHAT YOU OWE TO YOUR FINANCE COMPANY.</li>
							<li>PROVIDES UNINTENTIONAL VIOLATION COVER.</li>
							<li>REIMBURSES UP TO R6,000 OF YOUR INSURANCE EXCESS IN THE EVENT OF A SHORTFALL CLAIM.</li>
							<li>PROTECTS YOUR DEPOSIT UP TO A MAXIMUM OF R50,000 (OPTIONAL COVER).</li>
							<li>PAYS A LOYALTY BONUS OF R8,000 TOWARDS A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE OF YOUR CHOICE IN THE EVENT OF TOTAL LOSS PROVIDED YOUR VEHICLE IS REPLACED BY A MCCARTHY DEALERSHIP.</li>

						<p class="bold">Even the best drivers have no control over stone chips, trolley dents, hailstones or damage from other vehicles.</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, the day to day scrapes, scratches, chips and dents of everyday driving can be both expensive and annoying. Likewise, the interior of your car is also prone to tears, scratches and scuffs to items such as your dashboard, door handles, centre console, door panels etc. Seat fabric and stitching often becomes damaged and cigarette burns easily lower the value of your vehicle. Both exterior and interior damage can significantly affect your vehicles resale value.</p>
						<p>Now, with valuable protection from Bidvest Insurance you can keep your vehicle looking as perfect as the day you first bought it, both inside and out.</p>
						<p>The Bodyguard and the Bodyguard + Interiorguard policies are designed to keep your vehicle in showroom condition by paying for minor repairs to the exterior or interior of your vehicle. These policies are completely separate from your comprehensive motor insurance policy which means when you claim it won't affect your no-claims bonus or cash-back rewards.</p>
						<p><b>How it works</b></p>
						<p>It's easy – should you experience any damage to the exterior or interior of your vehicle, simply call us on 0861 66 88 88, where a consultant will talk you through the process and direct you to the nearest approved repairer. In some circumstances, it might be more convenient for a mobile unit to come to your premises to repair the vehicle. When your claim is authorised the repairs are completed so you are back on the road with your vehicle looking as good as new.</p>
						<p>The Bodyguard and the Bodyguard + Interiorguard policies are available for new and used vehicles and provide the following benefits depending on the option purchased. Bodyguard can either be purchased on its own or with the additional Interiorguard benefit.</p>
						<p>The Executive options offer additional benefits together with higher levels of cover for the more discerning vehicle owner.</p>
						<p class="bold">Policy Highlights</p>
						<ul>
							<li>IMPROVES THE RESALE VALUE OF YOUR VEHICLE.</li>
							<li>HELPS PROTECT YOUR NO CLAIMS BONUS AND CASH BACK REWARDS.</li>
							<li>KEEPS YOUR VEHICLE LOOKING AS GOOD AS NEW.</li>
							<li>CAR HIRE BENEFIT (AVAILABLE WITH EXECUTIVE OPTION).</li>
							<li>OPTIONAL INTERIORGUARD PROTECTS THE INSIDE OF YOUR VEHICLE.</li>
							<li>NO EXCESS PAYABLE ON CLAIMS.</li>
							<li>AFFORDABLE ONCE-OFF PAYMENT.</li>

						<p><b>Even if you're a careful driver, your vehicle's tyres are exposed to countless hazards every time you're on the road. That means no matter how well you drive, you're likely to experience some sort of damage to your tyres.</b></p>
						<p>This damage is both expensive and inconvenient but is rarely caused by your vehicle, or the way you drive. Instead, most tyre damage is caused by the roads we drive on, where potential hazards such as potholes, cracks and road debris are common.</p>
						<p>Thankfully, avoiding unexpected and expensive tyre replacement bills is easy with protection from Tyreguard – a simple insurance policy that covers your tyres for 60,000kms or 3 years (whichever comes first).</p>
						<p class="bold">How it works</p>
						<p>It's really simple – when you experience tyre damage, simply call the hotline on 0861 66 88 88 and an agent will direct you to the nearest approved tyre dealer to submit a claim for the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged tyre. You only pay for the tread that you've used.
						<p>But that's not all – when replacing a tyre, Tyreguard will also pay for the cost of balancing and wheel alignment of your vehicle's tyres. If the damaged tyre is punctured and can be repaired, Tyreguard will also cover the cost of repairs.</p>
						<p>Tyreguard is available for new and used vehicles and provides the following benefits, which are calculated as a percentage of the cost of replacing the damaged tyre.</p>
						<p class="bold">Policy Highlights</p>
						<ul>
							<li>3 YEAR/ 60,000KMS COVER.</li>
							<li>FREE PUNCTURE REPAIRS.</li>
							<li>FREE WHEEL BALANCING WITH EACH CLAIM.</li>
							<li>FREE WHEEL ALIGNMENT WHEN A DAMAGED TYRE IS REPLACED.</li>
							<li>100% REPLACEMENT WITHIN 2,000KMS OR 30 DAYS OF PURCHASE FOR NEW VEHICLES.</li>
							<li>AFFORDABLE ONCE-OFF PAYMENT.</li>

						<p><b>At McCarthy we understand how important it is for you to have peace of mind with your vehicle purchase.</b></p>
						<p>That's why McCarthy Auto Settlement ensures unforeseen circumstances such as accident, illness, retrenchment, sequestration/liquidation or death do not result in you or your loved ones losing the use of your vehicle.</p>
						<p><b>How it works</b></p>
						<p>
							Your dealer will calculate a premium (paid upfront or on a monthly basis) that allows you to protect you and your family in the event of the following:
						</p>
						<p><b>Accident or Illness Resulting in Temporary Disability</b></p>
						<p>Temporary disability through an accident or illness often results in a loss of income. It's this loss of income which might not only change your lifestyle but could result in you not being able to meet your monthly vehicle instalments. McCarthy Auto Settlement provides the solution by paying your vehicle instalments on your behalf for up to 6 months.</p>
						<p><b>Retrenchment</b></p>
						<p>In the event of retrenchment the policy pays your vehicle instalments for up to 4 months while you make provision to resume employment.</p>
						<p><b>Sequestration/Liquidation</b></p>
						<p>McCarthy Auto Settlement protects you in the event of your business being liquidated, or you being sequestrated, and will pay your vehicle instalments for up to 4 months.</p>

						<p><b>Permanent Disability</b></p>
						<p>Permanent Disability carries with it a tremendous financial burden and in such an event McCarthy Auto Settlement settles your outstanding debt with the finance company.</p>

						<p>McCarthy Auto Settlement will settle your outstanding debt with the finance company in the event of your death. This payment does not form part of your estate and is paid without any unnecessary delay.</p>

						<p><b>At McCarthy we understand how important it is to regularly service your vehicle and also how unplanned service costs can be frustrating. That’s why we've developed the McCarthy Service Plan to help you plan and save on future servicing costs.</b></p>

						</ul>
						<p><b>How it works</b></p>

When your vehicle is due for the required service you simply contact your McCarthy dealer to make an appointment and inform them that you have a McCarthy Service Plan. The dealer then contacts the McCarthy Service Plan Administrator to obtain authorisation prior to commencing your vehicle's service. The McCarthy Service Plan covers the cost of the routine servicing of your vehicle, as stipulated in the original manufacturer's service schedule.</p>
